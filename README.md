🧠 How the Game Works
Maze Generation: A randomized depth-first search (DFS) algorithm creates a solvable maze.

Player Movement: You move from the start to the goal by navigating white paths.

Obstacles: Red blocks appear/disappear periodically. Touching them results in failure.

Multiplayer Mode: Players take turns. The one who reaches the goal faster wins.

Scoring: Calculated based on time taken (in ticks/frames).
